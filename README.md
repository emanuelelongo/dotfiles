# Reminder for myself

If you made an OS clean install (shame on you) this is what you need to install/configure.

The list is not complete so, for your own sake, please remember to add or fix things.

## iTerm2
Install from [here](https://www.iterm2.com/)


## Homebrew
``` sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

## Nerd Font (so that iTerm2 prompt looks good)
```
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew cask install font-hack-nerd-font
```


## Zsh and Oh-My-Zsh
The system installed zsh is usually outdated and cannot be updated.
Install the new new one with brew and add the new one to the available shells.
``` sh
brew install zsh
echo "/usr/local/bin/zsh" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
exit
```
Oh-My-Zsh
``` sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

# A better prompt for zsh
git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k

# Syntax highlighting for zsh
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting

# Autocompletion for zsh
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

## Basic tools
``` sh
brew install bash
brew install shellcheck
brew install cmake
brew install jq
brew install httpie
brew install fd
brew install tree
brew cask install osxfuse
brew install sshfs
brew install lynx
brew install pandoc
brew install highlight
```

##Â Docker
Install Docker from its [official page](https://www.docker.com/)

## Node JS
Install N version manager (this will also install Node LTS version)

``` sh
curl -L https://git.io/n-install | bash
```

and then install Yarn (--without-node options is mandatory)
``` sh
brew install yarn --ignore-dependencies
```


## Rust
``` sh
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

## Go

```

## C# Refactoring from Vim
https://github.com/tinoji/Roslynator/blob/master/docs/RoslynatorForVisualStudioCode.md

## Dotfiles
``` sh
brew install stow
git clone https://github.com/emanuelelongo/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
# IMPORTANT: config folder require explicit target
stow config -t ~/.config
stow vim
stow git
# etc 
```

## iTerm2 configuration
iTerm2 -> Preferences -> "Load preferences from custom folder or URL"
Set to "/Users/<username>/.iterm2"

## Vim and Neovim
``` sh
brew install vim
brew install neovim
pip3 install neovim
```
Make neovim uses same configuration of vim
``` sh
mkdir -p .config/nvim
ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
```

Let's `vim` opens __nvim__ and `vi` opens __vim__
``` sh
mkdir bin
# assuming the version are still the same
ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/neovim/0.3.1/bin/nvim vim
ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/vim/8.1.0450/bin/vim vi
```

### VimPlug
For vim
``` sh
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

For neovim
``` sh
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

Then from vim and neovim run:
```
:PlugInstall
```

## Instal fzf and Ag
``` sh
brew install fzf
$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install
brew install ag
```
