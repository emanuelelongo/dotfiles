# Reminder

You need to install `stow` first:

``` sh
brew install stow
```

That said, you'll have a .dotfiles folder containg this repository.

Each folder in this repository contains one or more dotfile.

`stow` simply create symbolic link to your `~` folder.

Example

``` sh
cd ~/.dotfiles
stow vim
```
